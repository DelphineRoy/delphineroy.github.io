Welcome to my personal page. I'm a statistician and health economist, currently deputy director and head of the "health and long-term care" unit of the Institut des politiques publiques.

Here, you will find 
- a description of the projects I work on or have worked on since joining the IPP, under "Research projects"
- the papers I'm currently working on and links to my published papers, under "Publications"
- a CV
- a list of the courses I teach or have taught, under "Teaching"
- and some of the presentations I gave, under "Talks"
